A bug in the Play Store causes it to crash when clicking links to other Play Store apps. This happens if the URL is linked in the app description. A normal URL is automatically linked without using HTML, but a URL to a Play Store app requires HTML. When using the HTML link in an app description, clicking it causes Play Store to crash.

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps">link</a>
